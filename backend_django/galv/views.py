        Reports come with a 'status' field, which can be one of:
        - error: The harvester encountered an error and is reporting it.
        - success: The harvester is reporting a successful task.

        If the status is 'error', the report must include an 'error' field.
        This field is in JSON or string format.
        The report may also include 'path' and 'monitored_path_id' fields.
        A blank response will be returned ({}).

        If the status is 'success', the report must include 'task', 'path', and 'monitored_path_id' fields.
        Path is the absolute path of the file being reported on.
        Monitored path id is the id of the monitored path the file was found in.
        The task field can be one of:
        - file_size: The harvester is reporting the size of a file.
        - import: The harvester is reporting the result of an import.

        - * file metadata: The harvester is beginning an import.
        - * column metadata: The harvester is reporting progress on an import.
        - * upload parquet partitions: The harvester is uploading datafiles.
        - * upload complete: The harvester has completed uploading files.
        - harvest complete: The harvester has completed an import.
        - harvest failed: The harvester has failed to import a file.

        It may also include a 'parser' field identifying the parser used to import the file.
        The core_metadata and extra_metadata fields must be dictionaries.
        - core_metadata may include:
            - Machine Type: The type of machine used to generate the file.
            - Dataset Name: The name of the dataset.
            - num_rows: The number of rows in the dataset.
            - first_sample_no: The number of the first sample in the dataset.
            - last_sample_no: The number of the last sample in the dataset.
        Extra metadata will be stored as a JSON.

        If the stage is 'column metadata', the data must include a 'metadata' field.
        This field will be a list of dictionaries, each representing a column of data.
        Each dictionary must include a 'data_type' field.
        Each dictionary must include one of 'column_id' or 'unit_id' or 'unit_symbol'.
        Dictionaries that specify 'unit_id' or 'unit_symbol' may also specify 'column_name'.
        Dictionaries must include a 'values' field, which is a list of values.

        A representation of the file will be returned.

        If the stage is 'upload parquet partitions', the data must include 'row_count', 'partition_count',
        and 'partition_number' fields describing the total rows in the dataset (derived by inspecting the parquet
         object), the number of parquet partitions into which it is split, and the number of the current partition.
        A file must also be uploaded as a form data field named 'file'.
        The response will be the serialized ParquetPartition object created in response.

        If the stage is 'upload complete', the data must include 'successes',
        the number of successful partition uploads, and errors, a list of errors encountered while uploading.

        If the stage is 'harvest complete' or 'harvest failed', no additional content is required.

Validation schemas contain one or more definitions that describe requirements for Galv objects.
The possible values are available at `/keys/` and should be implemented in your schema thus:

```json
{
    ...
    "$defs": {
        "key_name": {
            ... description
        },
        ... and so on for any other keys
    },
    ...
```

For each of these schemas that is enabled, Galv will test the objects against the definition
by constructing a JSON Schema file that hooks in your definitions and asserts a single object.
This means you need not specify a root object (e.g. with `"type": "object"`) in your schema.

```json
{
    ...
    "type": {"$ref": "#/$defs/key_name"}
}
```

Because your definitions are included locally, you can include references to other definitions in your schema,
and Galv will automatically resolve them for you.

Galv will highlight any objects that do not meet the requirements.
This can allow you to specify a series of increasingly strict requirements for your lab's metadata.

Schemas are validated against _individually_, and are not checked for consistency.
If you declare that a particular field is a `string` in one schema and a `number` in another,
Galv will not complain, except to issue a warning for failing to adhere to one or the other schema.

Because schemas validate objects returned from the Galv API,
schemas should expect most relational fields to be represented as URLs.

Note: there are some requirements put in place by Galv's database structure.
These will always apply, and will generate errors rather than warnings.
