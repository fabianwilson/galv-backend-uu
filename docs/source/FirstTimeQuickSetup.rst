######################################################################################
First Time Quick Setup
######################################################################################

This section describes how to set up the system for the first time.
It is assumed you are logged into the server machine that you
wish to use, using the user account that you want to run the server with.
The entire application has been dockerised, so can in theory be used on
any major operating system with minimal modification.

**************************************************************************************
Deploying on fly.io
**************************************************************************************

The Galv team use fly.io to deploy the Galv application.
This is a cloud service that allows you to deploy docker containers to a server.

You can find the example configuration file for fly.io in the repository root directory
``fly.toml``. This file is used to configure the deployment of the Galv application.

To run the application it's easiest to use the prebuilt container which accompanies
each release on GitHub.
The containers are stored in GitHub's Container Registry.

To launch with fly.io, you will need to:

#. Install the fly.io CLI tool, which can be found `here <https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-fly/>`__.
#. Log in to the fly.io CLI tool using the command ``fly login``.
#. Create a new postgres database using the command ``fly postgres create``. The name you give it will be needed in step 5.
#. Create a new application using the command ``fly apps create``. The name you give it will be needed in step 5.
#. Attach the postgres database to the application using the command ``fly postgres attach <postgres_app_name> --app <galv_app_name>``.
#. Set the environment variables by modifying the ``fly.toml`` file. Most variables have sensible defaults.
   You will need to ensure that the ``VIRTUAL_HOST_ROOT`` is set to the domain name you wish to use - e.g. ``galv-app.fly.dev``.
   You will also need to ensure that the ``FRONTEND_VIRTUAL_HOST`` is set to the domain name you wish to use for the frontend - e.g. ``galv-frontend.fly.dev``.
#. Set the secret environment variables by running the command ``fly secrets set DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<secret_key>``.
   Do the same for the superusers's password with ``fly secrets set DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=<superuser_password>``.
#. Launch the application using the command ``fly deploy``.
   This will launch the latest version of the Galv backend on the fly.io server by looking for the container image
   in the GitHub Container Registry. It is possible to build your own version from the source code.

**************************************************************************************
Deploying on EC2 or other cloud services - single service
**************************************************************************************

You can deploy Galv on any cloud service that supports docker containers.
The following instructions are for deploying on an AWS EC2 instance.

#. Launch an EC2 instance with the Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
#. SSH into the instance.
#. Install docker.

   .. code-block:: shell

      sudo yum update -y
      sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
      sudo service docker start
      sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

#. Create a .env file with the environment variables you need.
   This can have both the normal and secret environment variables.
   You can use the .env file in the repository as a template.
   At the very least, you will need to set:

   * ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY``
   * ``DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD``
   * Postgres connection details using either ``POSTGRES_*`` variables or ``DATABASE_URL``
   * ``VIRTUAL_HOST_ROOT``
   * ``FRONTEND_VIRTUAL_HOST``

#. Build the container from the GitHub Container Registry.

   .. code-block:: shell

      docker run -d --env-file .env -p 80:80 ghcr.io/galv-team/galv-backend:latest

**************************************************************************************
Deploying from scratch
**************************************************************************************

You need to have ``docker``, ``docker-compose`` and ``git`` installed and available on your
command-line.

You can find installation instructions for ``docker`` on all major operating systems
`here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`__, and for ``docker-compose``
`here <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__. For linux hosts, it is useful to be
able to use ``docker`` as a non-root user, and you can find instructions on how to set
this up `here <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/>`__. If you don't,
note that you will need to add ``sudo ...`` in front of every ``docker`` and
``docker-compose`` command listed below.

Installation instructions for ``git`` for all major OSs can be found
`here <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`__.


Get the galv source code
=======================================================================================

First you will need to clone the galv repository using ``git``:

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://gitlab.com/galv-team/galv-project/galv.git
	cd galv


Setup environment variables
=======================================================================================

The Galv project uses two ``.env`` files, ``.env`` and ``.env.secret``.

You will already have a ``.env`` file in the repository you cloned, with sensible defaults.

If you're running a **production deployment**, you will want to set the value of the
``VIRTUAL_HOST_ROOT`` to your domain name, e.g. ``VIRTUAL_HOST_ROOT=example.com``.
This will serve the Galv web application from the root of your domain,
e.g. at ``http://example.com/``; and the API from the subdomain, e.g. ``http://api.example.com``.
You will likely also want to enable HTTPS, for which we use LetsEncrypt to generate SSL certificates.
By default, the staging (test) server is used, which generates certificates that are not trusted by browsers.
When your production setup appears to work correctly, you can switch to fetching real certificates
by setting ``LETSENCRYPT_TEST=false`` and restarting the nginx-proxy container.

If you wish to change where the database is saved, you can change the first entry
in ``.env``, ``GALV_DATA_PATH`` to the directory where you want the postgres database.

Create ``.env.secret``
=======================================================================================

The second ``.env`` file is a secrets file.
This is not included because you should come up with your own secret values for the
entries within it.
Create the file and edit it so that it has the following keys:

* ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY``
* ``DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD``
* ``POSTGRES_PASSWORD``

All of these values should be unguessable secure passwords.
``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`` should be very long and complex, consider 60+ characters
with a mixture of special characters (avoid $ and Â£), upper- and lower-case letters,
and numbers.
The only one of these you will need to use again will be the superuser password.

If you would like the Django superuser to have a name that is not 'admin',
you can also specify ``DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME``.

.. code-block:: shell

	vi .env.secret  # could also use nano, emacs, etc.


Build docker images (only when upgrading to a new version of galv)
=======================================================================================

If you have previously installed and run galv you might already have old docker
images already built. To rebuild the images, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	docker-compose build

**************************************************************************************
Running Galv
**************************************************************************************

You can run the galv server and web application frontend using the following
``docker-compose`` command from the root folder of the repository.

.. code-block:: bash

	docker-compose up app

Now view the 'localhost' IP address `http://127.0.0.1/ <http://127.0.0.1/>`_ in your
browser and you should see the Galv login page.
This is the web frontend.
If you wish to use the frontend from another machine,
use the IP address or URL of the server instead.

Creating a user account
========================================================================================

It's not a good idea to do everything with the Django superuser.
You can create a new account by using the web interface to POST to the API.
Go to the /users/ endpoint and fill in the DRF form.

You'll need to approve the account at the /activate/ endpoint.
Open up a web browser and go to the mailhog web port (default 8025 in ``docker-compose.yml``) to see the email,
then copy the activation code.

Go to ``/activate/?token=[your_code]&username=[your_username]`` in your browser to activate the account.
